## BUILDING SINGLE PERCEPTRON NEURAL NETWORK MODEL FOR REGRESSION PROBLEM FROM SCRATCH (NO ACTIVATION FUNCTION)
### 1. This projects is developed to understand the fundamentals of mathematics that goes behind the Neural network model. It covers topics such as Forward Propagation,Gradient descent , Backward propagation , concepts of weights and biases etc.
### 2. The Neural network model built here consisits one one perceptron having on einput feature and one output.
### 3. This model aims at solving the Regression problem.

## Workflow defined
#### a) Kaggle dataset -  "tvmarketing.csv"  data is imported as dataframe (containing two columns)
#### b) first column is x values and second column is the y values.There are total of 200 training data.
#### c) All values are normalized using Z-score normalization.
#### d) Arbitraty random values are assigned to weight (w) and 0 to bias (b) in matrix form.
#### e) predicted value "y_hat" is calculated using the formula:
