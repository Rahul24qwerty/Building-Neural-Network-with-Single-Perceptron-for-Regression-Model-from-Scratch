## BUILDING SINGLE PERCEPTRON NEURAL NETWORK MODEL FOR REGRESSION PROBLEM FROM SCRATCH (NO ACTIVATION FUNCTION)
### 1. This projects is developed to understand the fundamentals of mathematics that goes behind the Neural network model. It covers topics such as Forward Propagation,Gradient descent , Backward propagation , concepts of weights and biases etc.
### 2. The Neural network model built here consisits one one perceptron having on einput feature and one output.
### 3. This model aims at solving the Regression problem.
